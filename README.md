# Software-Engineering
Architecture Designs and SE Projects

Welcome to my first project: a 3-Layered Architecture message processor!

To build the project run the code below:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

If you already built it and are not running it for the first time then run:
```
mvn compile
```
To just quickly check the build:
```
mvn -o
````
For a full debugged check:
```
mvn -o -X 
```
